WELCOME = f"""👋 Welcome to [underline]{NAME} [white not bold]v{VERSION}[/white not bold][/underline]!

Practice as many words and phrases as you like, for as long as you like.

[secondary]{NAME} quizzes you on words and phrases repeatedly. Each time you answer
a quiz correctly, {NAME} will wait longer before repeating it. If you
answer incorrectly, you get one additional attempt to give the correct
answer. If the second attempt is not correct either, {NAME} will reset
the quiz interval.

How does it work?
● To answer a quiz: type the answer, followed by Enter
● To repeat the spoken text: type Enter without answer
● To quit: type Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D
